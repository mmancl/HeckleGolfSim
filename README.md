## Course Generation & Creator

### OpenStreetMap (OSM) Real-World Course Importer
`Courses/OsmMapLoader.cs` and the in-game Download Dialog allow you to search and download **any golf course in the world** directly into the game:
- **Global Search**: Queries OpenStreetMap Overpass API endpoints for `leisure=golf_course`, `golf=fairway`, `golf=green`, `golf=bunker`, `golf=tee`, and `golf=hole`.
- **Elevation Integration**: Downloads digital terrain elevation models to generate realistic 3D topography, rolling hills, and elevation changes.
- **3D Procedural Mesh Generation**: Generates 3D polygonal meshes (`ArrayMesh`) for each surface with collision shapes and surface physics tags (`"surface_type"`).
- **Automated Caching**: Courses are compiled into Godot `PackedScene` files (`user://courses/{course_name}/course.tscn`) with structured metadata (`course.json`) for instantaneous loading on subsequent playthroughs.

![OpenStreetMap Course Downloader](assets/images/screenshots/osm_course_downloader.png)
*OpenStreetMap Downloader: Search real-world golf courses worldwide and procedurally generate 3D course layouts.*

### In-Game Custom Course Creator
- Use the built-in Custom Course Creator (`UI/CustomCourseCreator/`) to layout your own golf holes.
- Plot tee boxes, fairway boundaries, green perimeters, and hazard locations with interactive vector tools.

### Course Loading & Discovery Architecture
![Course Addition Architecture](assets/images/course_addition_components.png)
- `CourseValidator` validates each course directory upon discovery (verifying `course.json`, title, par configuration, and scene integrity).
- `CourseList` indexes validated courses into UI metadata for fast, responsive selection.
- `CourseManager` instantiates and manages course transitions through `SceneManager`.

## Dynamic Commentary & Heckle Announcer Engine
The announcer engine (`addons/announcer/AnnouncerEngine.cs`) brings personality and humor to every round:
- **Smart Context Detection**: Analyzes ball telemetry in real time to categorize shots:
  - **Slices & Hooks**: Humorous commentary on sharp curves and migrating balls.
  - **Crushed Drives / Bombs**: Praise for flushed shots traveling over 270+ yards.
  - **Bunkers & Kitty Litter**: Beach roasts when landing in sand traps.
  - **Wormburners & Skyballs**: Roasts for low skimmers (< 4° launch) or sky-high popups.
  - **Duffs & Topped Shots**: Witty remarks for shots under 20 yards.
  - **Idle Banter**: Quips if the golfer takes too long between swings (45-second timer).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration**: Utilizes native platform TTS engines (Godot `DisplayServer.TtsSpeak` and `AndroidTTS.cs`).
- **Customizable**: Adjust pitch, rate, speech voice, and independently toggle praise or heckles in the Settings menu.

---

## AI Golfer Camera & MediaPipe Pose Tracking
Heckle Golf Simulator includes a real-time swing analysis and golfer pose estimation system (`UI/GolferCamera/`):
- **Native Android MediaPipe GPU Plugin**: Powered by `MediaPipePosePlugin.aar`, utilizing MediaPipe Pose Landmarker Lite running directly on the Android GPU.
- **Live 33-Point Skeletal Landmark Overlay**: Displays full-body skeletal tracking over the golfer's live camera feed.
- **Real-Time Swing Telemetry**:
  - Swing tempo and backswing-to-downswing timing ratio (e.g., 3:1 tempo).
  - Spine angle maintenance throughout the swing.
  - Shoulder turn and hip rotation angles.
  - Top-of-backswing (address), impact, and follow-through detection.
- **Swing Replay Modal**: Buffer and replay recorded swings with slow-motion scrub and frame-by-frame review.

---

## Ball Physics & Aerodynamics
Ball flight is powered by the **OpenFairway v1.0.6** physics system combined with Godot's **JoltPhysics3D** engine:
- Ball flight transitions through discrete states: `FLIGHT`, `ROLLOUT`, and `REST`.
- Horizontal distance is calculated in meters and converted to yards in UI readouts (`carry`, `total`, `apex`, `offline`).

### Reynolds Number Aerodynamic Modeling
Drag ($C_d$) and Lift ($C_l$) coefficients are calculated dynamically in `physics/aerodynamics.gd` based on Reynolds number ($Re$) and spin ratio ($S$):
$$Re = \frac{\rho \cdot v \cdot d}{\mu}$$
- **$Re < 50\text{k}$**: Low Reynolds regime (slow wedges and short chips under 77 mph) — constant $C_l = 0.1$.
- **$50\text{k} < Re < 75\text{k}$**: Polynomial transition interpolation between regime models.
- **$75\text{k} < Re < 200\text{k}$**: Linear model for normal golf shots (77–155 mph).
- **$Re > 200\text{k}$**: Clamped high-velocity aerodynamic regime (extreme long drive speeds).
- A Python validation script (`assets/scripts/reynolds_calculator.py`) is provided for aerodynamic model verification.

### Turf Interaction & Rollout Tuning
- Surface presets (Firm, Fairway, Soft Fairway, Rough, Sand, Green) dynamically apply kinetic friction ($\mu_k$), rolling resistance ($\mu_{kr}$), and grass drag ($\nu_g$) via `physics/surface.gd`.
- Informed by USGA Stimpmeter and turf friction literature:
  - [USGA Green Speed Physics (Deceleration on Greens)](https://www.waddengolfacademy.com/putting/USGA%20Green%20Speed%20Physics.pdf)
  - [Jenkins et al., “Drag Coefficients of Golf Balls” (World Journal of Mechanics 2018)](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/WJM_2018062515520887.pdf)
  - [USGA Stimpmeter Measuring Guide](https://www.usga.org/content/dam/usga/pdf/imported/StimpmeterBookletFINAL.pdf)

## Hardware & Launch Monitor Connectivity

### Square Launch Monitor (Direct BLE / Serial / TCP)
Full native support for the Square Golf Launch Monitor under `addons/launch_monitors/square/`:
- Connects directly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Serial Port, or TCP network socket.
- Decodes full binary protocol packets into Godot shot metrics (Ball Speed, Launch Angle, Direction, Total Spin, Spin Axis, Club Speed).
- Real-time device state events (`Connected`, `Ready`, `BallDetected`, `ShotReceived`, `Disconnected`).

### GSPro Open Connect v1 TCP Listener
A built-in C# TCP server (`addons/launch_monitors/common/tcp_server/TcpServer.cs`) listens on port **`49152`** for standard GSPro Open Connect v1 JSON packets. Any launch monitor bridge (PiTrac, Garmin, FlightScope, etc.) sending to port 49152 works seamlessly out of the box.
